# week-1-exploringmarkdown

## overview

This is an example of using markdown for our topic discussion.

### what I learned about markdown

1. It is a fairly simple language
2. It is futureproof and fairly universal
3. Used for README files on projects

### reflection

Markdown felt like a pretty straightforward language to learn. I can see how it would be useful giving context to a project or taking notes.

### task list

- [x] Create an example markdown file
- [ ] Post it into the discussion on Moodle
